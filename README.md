# Bomberminä
**A online PvP bomberguy gamemode for Noita**  
This is a bomberman clone written for Noita using my Noita Online framework.  
It requires [Noita Online](https://github.com/EvaisaDev/noita-online) to function.  

*Features:*
- Lobby settings for map size, powerups percentage, etc.
- 7 powerups.
- Top down perspective.
- what else is there to say, it is bomberman.
